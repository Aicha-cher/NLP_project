# Problem Statement

We are using for this analysis data comming from <https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/E-thos_Project_Climate_Change/12964481?file=24696182> this
data is of statements made by witnesses giving testimony before congress on climate
change.
Thus we know that all the documents parts of this corpus deal with climate change,
but we want to understand in more details the different scopes of climate changes
each testimony is discussing.
